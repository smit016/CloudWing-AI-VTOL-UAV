# CloudWing-AI-VTOL-UAV
This repository documents the step-by-step design and development of a hybrid VTOL UAV, with emphasis on cruise efficiency, wing sizing, airfoil selection, and structural design. The project follows an iterative aircraft design workflow and considers realistic operating conditions such as turbulence and crosswind disturbances.
